Privacy Policy
Last updated: [07/08/2025]
This Privacy Policy explains how The Sound: Sleep, Focus, Relax ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your data when you use our mobile application.

1. **Developer Information**
   Developer / Publisher Name: Splat Team
   Contact Email: splatpublisher84@gmail.com
   Company Address: Da Nang, Viet Nam

2. **Data We Collect**
   We collect certain types of data to deliver and improve the app’s functionality. The data we collect falls into the following categories:
   Personal Information:
   If the app includes optional features like account creation, feedback forms, or newsletter sign-up, users may be asked to provide personal information such as name or email address. This data is used solely for communication or personalization and will never be sold or shared without consent.
   Audio Input (Microphone Access):
   The app may request access to your device’s microphone for the purpose of analyzing ambient sound in your environment (e.g. background noise level, frequency patterns). This enables us to suggest soundscapes or noise layers that best fit your current surroundings. No audio is recorded, saved, or shared — all analysis is processed in real time on the device or through secure channels.
   Device Information:
   We may collect basic technical details such as device model, operating system version, app version, and language settings. This information helps us optimize app performance and fix bugs specific to certain devices or systems.
   You may request assistance with purchase-related issues or refunds by contacting us at [email của bạn]. We will do our best to support you, but refund decisions are subject to app store policies.
   Usage Data:
   We collect anonymized information about how the app is used — such as feature interactions, session duration, and sound types selected. This data helps us improve user experience, develop new features, and understand user preferences.
   If required by law (e.g. in the EU), we provide users with the ability to opt out of analytics tracking or limit data collection. You may request this by contacting us at [Email liên hệ].
   We do not collect:
   GPS data or physical location
   Contact lists, photos, or other sensitive user content
   Biometric or financial data
   All collected data is either:
   Provided directly by the user
   Collected automatically for functional and improvement purposes.
   We prioritize user privacy and collect only what is necessary to deliver a personalized and enjoyable audio experience.
   We do not sell or rent user data under any circumstances.

3. **How We Use Your Data**
   We use the collected data for purposes such as:
   Personalizing sound recommendations based on space or activity
   Improving app performance and fixing bugs
   Understanding usage patterns (analytics)
   Optional: Delivering personalized ads (only with consent)
   We may display advertisements through Google AdMob in our app. To do this, Google may collect certain data (such as your device information and advertising ID) to deliver personalized ads or limit ad frequency. This data is processed in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.

4. **In-App Purchases**
   Our app offers optional in-app purchases that allow users to access premium features or remove ads. When you make a purchase, payment and billing information is handled securely by the [App Store / Google Play Store], not by us directly.
   We do not collect or store any credit card or payment information on our servers.
   Transaction data (e.g. purchase history, subscription status) may be accessed via the app stores' APIs to:
   Unlock purchased content
   Manage active subscriptions
   Restore purchases upon reinstallation

5. **Third-Party Sharing:**
   We may use third-party services such as:
   [Google Analytics for Firebase] – for analytics
   We use third-party services such as Firebase by Google to help us understand how users interact with the app, fix crashes, and improve performance.
   Firebase may collect anonymized data such as:
   Device information (model, OS version, language)
   Usage patterns (which screens are visited, session duration)
   Crash logs (to diagnose and fix bugs)
   We use Firebase Analytics to log specific in-app events (e.g. button taps, feature usage) to better understand user behavior and improve the experience. This data is aggregated and does not contain personally identifiable information.
   This information is processed in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.The data collected is used only for analytics and technical improvement. We do not use Firebase data to serve personalized advertising unless explicitly stated and consented to.
   [Facebook SDK / Google Ads] – if advertising is used
   Google Admod
   Our app uses third-party SDKs, including Google AdMob, to serve advertisements. These SDKs may collect and use information such as:
   Device and network information (e.g. OS version, IP address, device ID)
   Interactions with ads (e.g. clicks, impressions)
   Advertising ID (for personalized ads, if enabled)
   We may allow AdMob to display personalized or non-personalized ads, depending on your preferences. Users in the EU and certain other regions will be prompted to consent to personalized advertising as required by the GDPR.
