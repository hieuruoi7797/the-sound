[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,

## Troubleshooting

**MissingPluginException?**
If you see an error like `MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method ...)`, make sure to:

1. Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get` in your project directory.
2. Do a full restart of your app (`flutter run`), not just a hot reload or hot restart.
3. If you changed any native code or added/removed plugins, always do a full clean and rebuild.
4. Make sure you are running on a supported platform (Android/iOS, not web or desktop for native plugins).
